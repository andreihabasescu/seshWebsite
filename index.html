		<h1>Why SESH?</h1>
		<div class="content">
			<p><strong>TeamSESH</strong> takes the small producers under it's wing bringing out the best of both the fans and creators. Small but tight community growing under the deadboy banner united through the music released by the group which covers a large variety of themes. Well written lyrics, uniquely produced tracks combined with covers sung by the spine chilling voice of <strong>Bones</strong> gives the public the niche aesthetic it's looking for.</p>
